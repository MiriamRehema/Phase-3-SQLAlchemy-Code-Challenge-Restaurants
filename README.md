## Description

This project revolves around utilizing SQLAlchemy, a widely-used Object Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python. Our objectives encompass database schema migrations, the establishment of object relationships, and the implementation of a range of methods to interact with our models. These models include classes such as Restaurant, Customer, and Review. The following README will provide a comprehensive guide for the tasks and expected deliverables. Prerequisites Before diving into the project, ensure you have the following in place:
SQLAlchemy installed.

Initial Restaurant and Customer models, database tables, and sample data.
A reviews table created via migration, including columns to establish relationships with Restaurant and Customer, as well as a star_rating column to store review ratings.

# Installation Process

Frontend

* Git clone the repository 'git clone git@github.com:MiriamRehema/.git`Phase-3-SQLAlchemy-Code-Challenge-Restaurants`
* Navigate to the project directory with the command `cd Phase-3-SQLAlchemy-Code-Challenge-Restaurants`

## Technology used
The challenge was mainly based on Python, so I used the following technologies:
- Python(your version)
-
## Conclusion
Completing this challenge was a great opportunity for me to use my knowledge of Python. I had a nice experience working on the different tasks and I look forward to building more projects using Python.




# Migration

Create a migration for the reviews table with the necessary columns to establish relationships with Restaurant and Customer. Include a star_rating column to store review ratings.

# Object Relationship Methods
Review Class

customer(): Returns the Customer instance associated with this review.
restaurant(): Returns the Restaurant instance associated with this review.

Restaurant Class

add_review(restaurant, rating): Creates a new review for the specified restaurant with the given rating.
delete_reviews(restaurant): Removes all reviews by the customer for a specific restaurant.

Review Class

full_review(): Returns a formatted review string, e.g., "Review for {restaurant name} by {customer's full name}: {review star_rating} stars."

Restaurant Class

fanciest(): Returns one restaurant instance with the highest price.
all_reviews(): Returns a list of strings with all the reviews for this restaurant, formatted as specified.

# Usage

Create database tables and initial data using migrations and the seeds.py file.
Implement methods and test them in the console using sample data.
Follow the suggested order of tasks, but feel free to adapt based on your preference.
Ensure methods work as expected and test thoroughly before proceeding.
Refactor code for clean and maintainable organization.

This project does include automated tests.
